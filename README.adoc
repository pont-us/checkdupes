= checkdupes: check duplicate files between directories

== Brief description

For specified directories `main` and `additional`, checkdupes lists
all the files in `additional` which are not present in `main`.
In other words: if `F(main)` and `F(additional)` are the sets of
files in the respective directories, checkdupes displays the
contents of the set `F(additional) âˆ’ F(main)`.

== Rationale

When reorganizing or cleaning up an old project, I often end up with a
large, canonical directory (let's call it `main`) containing all the data
files in a well-organized structure. Frequently, I will come across a
smaller directory (call it `additional`) containing a miscellaneous
collection of files, most of them probably duplicates of files already in
the `main` directory hierarchy (possibly under a different name or path).
checkdupes is designed to answer the question '`Which, if any, files in
`additional` are not already present in `main`?`'.

In short, checkdupes tells me:

. whether I can safely delete `additional` without losing data, and
. which, if any, files from `additional` I need to copy into `main`
  before I can safely delete `additional`.

checkdupes ignores file paths and names, and identifies each file using
its SHA-512 hash. Duplicates _within_ either of the two specified
directories make no difference: checkdupes only cares about the set of
files within each of `main` and `additional`, not how many duplicates
of a file either of them contains.
